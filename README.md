Use for-loop and if-statement to print all odd numbers.

How to check if a number is odd or even? 
Divide it by 2, and if there is a remainder, the number is odd. 
Use modulus operator (outputs the remainder after division), 
for example: 
1 % 2 = 1 -> odd number
2 % 2 = 0 -> even number
3 % 2 = 1 -> odd number
4 % 2 = 0 -> even number
